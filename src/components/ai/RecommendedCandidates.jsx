      const prompt = `You are a WORLD-CLASS technical recruiter and talent acquisition expert with 25+ years of experience across ALL technology domains and industries. Your specialty is PRECISE candidate-job matching using deep semantic understanding of roles, technologies, and career trajectories.

**CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY: ZERO FALSE POSITIVES**
Your reputation depends on ONLY recommending candidates who are GENUINELY qualified for THIS SPECIFIC role. A wrong recommendation wastes everyone's time and damages credibility.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS (MUST MATCH PRECISELY):**
${jobContext}

**CANDIDATE POOL (${eligibleCandidates.length} pre-filtered candidates with at least one required skill):**
${candidateSummaries.map((c, i) => `
[CANDIDATE ${i}]
${c}
`).join('\n---\n')}

**UNIVERSAL TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN INTELLIGENCE:**

You must understand the SEMANTIC MEANING and RELATIONSHIPS between technologies, not just exact string matching. Use your deep knowledge of:

**1. TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEMS & DOMAINS:**
- **Web Development:** Frontend (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte) vs Backend (Node.js, Django, Rails, Spring) vs Full Stack (both)
- **Mobile Development:** iOS (Swift, Objective-C) vs Android (Kotlin, Java) vs Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter)
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS vs Azure vs GCP (fundamentally different despite similar services)
- **Enterprise Software:** Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, Workday (siloed ecosystems, NOT general web dev)
- **Data Engineering:** Spark, Hadoop, Airflow, Kafka (specialized, NOT general backend)
- **DevOps/SRE:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Jenkins (infrastructure, NOT software development)
- **Data Science/ML:** Python (ML libraries), TensorFlow, PyTorch (specialized, NOT general programming)
- **Embedded/IoT:** C, C++, RTOS (low-level, NOT web development)
- **Game Development:** Unity, Unreal Engine (specialized, NOT web development)
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Web3 (specialized, NOT general backend)

**2. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERABILITY MATRIX:**

**Highly Transferable (80-100% overlap):**
- React ↔ React.js ↔ ReactJS (same technology, naming variants)
- Node.js ↔ NodeJS ↔ Node (same technology)
- JavaScript ↔ TypeScript (TypeScript is JS superset, 90% transferable)
- AWS EC2 ↔ Azure VMs ↔ GCP Compute (similar cloud compute concepts)
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) - fundamentally similar relational concepts

**Moderately Transferable (50-79% overlap):**
- React ↔ Vue ↔ Angular (different frameworks, similar frontend concepts)
- Python (general) ↔ Python (ML/Data Science) - same language, different domain
- Java (Backend) ↔ Kotlin (Backend) - JVM ecosystem
- .NET Core ↔ .NET Framework (evolution of same platform)

**Low Transferability (20-49% overlap):**
- Frontend (React) ↔ Backend (Node.js) - different layers, some JS overlap
- iOS (Swift) ↔ Android (Kotlin) - different platforms, similar mobile concepts
- SQL ↔ NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) - fundamentally different data paradigms

**NOT Transferable (0-19% overlap) - AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION:**
- Salesforce (Apex) ↔ Full Stack (React/Node) - completely different ecosystems ❌
- Data Engineering (Spark) ↔ Web Development (React) - completely different domains ❌
- DevOps (Kubernetes) ↔ Frontend Development - completely different focus ❌
- Game Development (Unity) ↔ Web Development - completely different domains ❌
- Embedded (C/RTOS) ↔ Web Development - completely different paradigm ❌

**3. ROLE TAXONOMY & SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:**

**Software Engineering Roles:**
- **Frontend Developer:** Client-side web (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Backend Developer:** Server-side logic (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, databases)
- **Full Stack Developer:** BOTH frontend AND backend (must have both skill sets)
- **Mobile Developer:** Native or cross-platform mobile apps
- **DevOps Engineer:** Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment automation
- **Data Engineer:** ETL pipelines, data warehousing, big data processing
- **Data Scientist/ML Engineer:** Machine learning models, statistical analysis
- **QA/Test Engineer:** Testing frameworks, automation, quality assurance

**Enterprise Software Roles (Separate Ecosystem):**
- **Salesforce Developer:** Apex, Lightning, SOQL (NOT general web development)
- **SAP Consultant:** ABAP, SAP modules (NOT general programming)
- **ServiceNow Developer:** ServiceNow platform (NOT general web development)
- **Oracle Developer:** PL/SQL, Oracle Forms (NOT general web development)

**CRITICAL RULE: Enterprise Software ≠ General Software Development**
Salesforce Developers, SAP Consultants, ServiceNow Developers work in CLOSED, PROPRIETARY ecosystems. They are NOT Full Stack, Frontend, or Backend developers in the general sense.

**STRICT MATCHING PROTOCOL:**

**STEP 1: DOMAIN VERIFICATION (Pass/Fail)**
- Extract the PRIMARY TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN from the job title and required skills
- Extract the PRIMARY TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN from each candidate's experience
- **IF domains are NOT compatible (0-19% transferability):** SCORE = 0, REJECT immediately
- **ONLY proceed if domains match or are moderately/highly transferable (50%+ overlap)**

**STEP 2: SKILL MATCHING (0-50 points)**
For EACH required skill:
- **Exact Match** (same technology): 10 points
- **High Transfer Variant** (80%+ transferable): 8 points
- **Moderate Transfer** (50-79% transferable): 5 points
- **Low Transfer** (20-49% transferable): 2 points (still useful)
- **No Transfer** (0-19%): 0 points (missing skill)

**Recency Multiplier:**
- Used in last 12 months: Full points
- Used 1-2 years ago: 0.7x points
- Used 2+ years ago: 0.4x points
- No recent proof: 0.3x points

**DISQUALIFICATION RULES:**
- If candidate missing > 50% of required skills (ANY score level): MAX SCORE = 50 (not qualified)
- If ANY critical must-have skill is completely missing: MAX SCORE = 40

**STEP 3: EXPERIENCE ALIGNMENT (0-20 points)**
- **Seniority Match:**
  - Exact level (Senior for Senior): 12 points
  - One level off (Mid for Senior): 8 points
  - Two levels off: 4 points
  - Wrong track (Frontend for Backend): -15 points (major penalty)

- **Years of Experience:**
  - Matches requirement ±1 year: 8 points
  - Within 2 years: 5 points
  - Under-qualified by 3+ years: -10 points (penalty)
  - Over-qualified by 6+ years: -5 points (flight risk)

**STEP 4: DOMAIN EXPERTISE (0-15 points)**
- Same industry/domain: 12 points
- Adjacent industry: 7 points
- Transferable domain: 3 points
- No relevant domain: 0 points

**STEP 5: ADDITIONAL FACTORS (0-15 points)**
- Each preferred skill matched: +2 points (max 10)
- Modern tooling/practices: +3 points
- Leadership experience (if required): +2 points

**CONFIDENCE TIERS:**
- **90-100:** Perfect fit, interview immediately
- **75-89:** Strong fit, definitely interview
- **60-74:** Acceptable fit, phone screen
- **< 60:** Not qualified, DO NOT RECOMMEND

**YOUR TASK:**

1. **For EACH candidate:**
   - Step 1: Verify technology domain compatibility (Pass/Fail gate)
   - Step 2: Count EXACT and TRANSFERABLE skill matches with recency weighting
   - Step 3: Verify seniority and experience alignment
   - Step 4: Calculate strict score using rubric above
   - **IF score < 60: REJECT - they don't qualify**

2. **Be DOMAIN-AWARE:**
   - Understand that a "Python Developer" could be backend OR data science - check job context
   - Recognize that "Engineer" in Salesforce vs "Engineer" in React are DIFFERENT roles
   - Know when skills are complementary vs. mutually exclusive

3. **Only return candidates scoring 60+ (qualified threshold)**

4. **Rank by score (highest first), max 10 results**

5. **Be BRUTALLY HONEST:**
   - Better to return ZERO candidates than recommend wrong ones
   - Don't inflate scores to be helpful
   - Don't force matches that don't exist

**EXAMPLES OF CORRECT REASONING:**

**Example 1: Full Stack Job (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL)**
- ✅ Candidate with React + Express + MongoDB: Score ~85 (high transfer, similar stack)
- ✅ Candidate with Vue + Node.js + PostgreSQL: Score ~78 (Vue↔React moderate transfer)
- ❌ Candidate with Salesforce + Apex: Score 0 (wrong domain entirely)
- ❌ Candidate with React only: Score ~45 (missing backend, not full stack)

**Example 2: Salesforce Developer Job (Apex, Lightning, SOQL)**
- ✅ Candidate with Salesforce + Apex + Lightning: Score ~95 (perfect match)
- ✅ Candidate with Salesforce Admin + some Apex: Score ~72 (good match, junior level)
- ❌ Candidate with Java + Spring Boot: Score 0 (wrong domain, Java ≠ Apex)
- ❌ Candidate with React + Node.js: Score 0 (wrong domain entirely)

**Example 3: Data Engineer Job (Spark, Hadoop, Python, SQL)**
- ✅ Candidate with Spark + Python + SQL: Score ~88 (strong match)
- ✅ Candidate with ETL tools + SQL + some Python: Score ~70 (acceptable match)
- ❌ Candidate with Python (Django web apps): Score ~35 (wrong domain, Python web ≠ data)
- ❌ Candidate with React + TypeScript: Score 0 (wrong domain entirely)
